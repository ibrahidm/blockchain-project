# Blockchain Project

This project was built as part of a code-along udemy course in order to learn about blockchain implementation and digital currency. 

Building this project was foundational in teaching me test-driven-development, and I am now able to comfortably build and test projects uing the jest suit. 

This project also improved my grasp of object-oriented programming and the Pub-Sub pattern. 

Most of the code is similar to the code written in the code-along videos with a few variations in implementation (but not functionality) scattered throughout.
